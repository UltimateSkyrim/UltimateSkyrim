List of basic resistances used in Skyrim.
|Type 	|	Cap|
|--|--|
|Damage (Armor Rating)| 	 	80%
|Poison| 	 	90%
|Fire  |	 	90%
|Frost |	 	90%
|Shock |	 	90%
|Magic |	 	90%

About AR (Armor Resistance) Values
  -  1 point reduces incoming physical damage by 0.1%. So 800 AR will reach the 80% cap when not considering Armor Penetration.
  -  1 point of Armor Penetration (AP) effectively reduces target AR by 1%. This means striking target with 500 AR with 10 AP makes the effective AR 450, making the target take 45% reduced damage not 50%.
  -  The AR cap applies after applying AP.

About AP (Armor Penetration) Values
Melee attacks and ranged attacks can penetrate armor, which reduces the effective armor rating and thus damage reduction of the target.

- Per point of armor penetration will bypass 1% of the target's armor rating with ranged attacks and melee power attacks. Standard melee attacks will bypass 0.5% of the target's armor rating per point of armor penetration. The maximum which can be bypassed at most 80% of the target's armor rating. 

- In ranged combat the ammunition used plays a key role for armor penetration.
