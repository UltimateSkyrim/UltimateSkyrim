## **Installing Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim with Seg's patch**

Even if you are familiar with[ Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545?tab=description), do check out the changes in[ Seg's Requiem patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=description) used here. Some of the tweaks are significant.

About the Ult Sky patch:

* _Forwarded all relevant scripts from "Book Covers Skyrim" book records. Retained book models and inventory art from "Book Covers Skyrim" mod._
* _Fixed a minor error in Stendarr's Fortify Block effect._
* _Arkay's Chalice of Life restoration effect now works as intended. Requiem's "No Natural Regen" permanent spell was blocking it._
* _Forwarded the appropriate quest activators that unlock the various daedric blessings._
* _Applied quest journal logs from "Even Better Quest Objectives" mod._
* _Resolved a script conflict with "House of Horrors Alternate Ending" mod._
* _Fixed a few invalid references in Seg's patch (it was made for an older version of Wintersun)._
* _Resolved a few magic effect conflicts related to blessings, and a couple of quest conflicts with "The Choice is Yours" mod._

To install:

1. Download and install[ Wintersun 3.1.5](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545?tab=files) with MO2. Load the esp plugin anywhere between _Book Covers Skyrim.esp_ and _Requiem.esp._ On the screenshot below it is right before _Requiem.esp_. Mod position on the left side of MO does not matter (end of the mod list is fine).
2. Download and install[ Wintersun - Requiem patch (v1.4)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=files) from Segolia94's patch collection. Load the esp between _Ultimate Skyrim.esp_ and _Requiem for the Indifferent.esp_.
3. Install [Wintersun 3.1.5 - Seg 1.4 - Ultsky 407](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hP53c8KQQz4plQGNl-qlLSpMnYFRVy0d/view?usp=sharing) On the left side of MO2 keep this patch **after** Wintersun mod and Seg's patch. On the right side of MO load the esp **after** Seg's patch and also **after** _Ultimate Skyrim - Book Covers Skyrim.esp_ **_._** You can place both patches there, as shown on the screenshot below.
4. Run the Reqtificator. Done.

_Note: If you are a Sanguine worshipper, and you are also using SNBCJ's "Requiem - Classic Food and Drink (R-CFD)" mod, make sure to load the Wintersun patches after the R-CFD patch, so that you'll get the correct effect from alcohol which boosts favor with Sanguine the more you drink._

*_Installing over an existing save:_

_Starting a new game is always the safest option when installing scripted mods. From my limited testing it seems to work fine when installed mid-game. Just make sure to let any active blessings expire before installing._

## **Installing Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim**

This[ standing stone overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89219?tab=description) allows for some very interesting play styles. It is pretty much compatible out of the box, with one minor exception pertaining to the Undeath mod (optional patch posted). I haven't changed anything in terms of balance because nothing strikes me as balance-breaking at first glance (_EDIT: see comments below_), but I've only just started using the mod. Do leave some feedback if you think something needs tweaking.

As in base Requiem, once you choose a standing stone, you can only switch to other stones within the[ same group](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/wiki/standing_stones#wiki_standing_stones_of_requiem_.28v_3.0.29).

To install:

1. Download and install[ Andromeda 1.0.9](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89219?tab=files) with MO2. Load the esp **after** _Ultimate Skyrim.esp_ on the right side of MO.
2. Download and install[ Andromeda 1.0.9 - Ultsky 4.0.7 MCM Descriptions](https://mega.nz/file/aVsl0YJa#6yaVKCFutL85qcqChc668d7udVCu8ASKO5YT9KhTBQU) to update the descriptions in the Ult Sky MCM. No plugin here, just a text file. On the left side of MO keep this patch **after** _Ultimate Skyrim_ mod.
3. [Optional] Install the patch[ Andromeda - Undeath Ritual Stone patch](https://drive.google.com/open?id=141SgIO7hjle7Y2j-YHv2-edYak74AROS) if you intend to play the Undeath quest line. Load the plugin **after** _Andromeda - Unique Standing Stones of Skyrim.esp_ on the right side.
4. Run the Reqtificator. Done.

_Installing_ _on an existing save:_

If you install this mod mid-game, the standing stones in Skyrim will be updated, but your currently active abilities may not be updated automatically. To reset your active powers after installing the mod, travel to a different standing stone in the[ same group](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/wiki/standing_stones#wiki_standing_stones_of_requiem_.28v_3.0.29) and activate it. Then travel back to your original standing stone and re-activate it. See the stone locations[ here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Standing_Stone). (To speed up the process you can use 'coc' in the console to teleport to each standing stone. The "Console Location Code" is listed on the individual standing stone pages).
