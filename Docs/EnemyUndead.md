##Dragon Priest
Thousands of years ago, these priests ruled over Skyrim at the behest of their Dragon overlords. 
In their service, many of these dragon priests were granted extraordinary powers and knowledge in arcana, and some of them managed to reach lichdom to evade their own demise. 
They are typically buried in one of the many ancient tombs and temples dotted all across Skyrim, awaiting the return of Alduin the "World-Eater."
