- You need to be carrying the full price of the house(before 'thane' deductions), even after completing the 'thane' quest (E.G if a hourse costs 35,000 before deductions, this is how much gold you need to be carrying, even though the house now only costs 20,000)

### Wearable lanterns
This mod is "touchy" in SE and breaks easily. 

1) You cannot turn on and off the light using the "L" hotkey

Workaround: use the MCM to change its slot to 46(cloak slot), equip the lantern, requip your cloak, then change the lanterns slot back to 56.

2) You spawn a carpet instead of a light.

Workaround:  Drop the lantern and console yourself a new one then Follow the procedure for issue 1.

If bathing in very cold water, it can kill you before the animation finishes. 

Work around: dont take a bath in cold water ;)
