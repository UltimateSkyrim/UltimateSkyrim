# What is Wildlander?

Wildlander is the new name for "Ultimate Skyrim SE". We chose to rebrand the project to seperate it from the Ultimate Skyrim list and reduce confusion.

The Modlist is a complete rebuild from the ground up, so some of the features you maybe used to are not available, either because they haven't been converted to SE (and were too complex to be done so by us) Examples of this - Atronoch crossing, easy wheel. Because the versions available for SE have major changes which would require rebalancing (Hejarchen farm) Or simply don't work (Dark dungeons, Locked city gates, Full version of ESF).

This isn't to say some of these features won't return in some fashion in the next few builds, just that they didn't make the deadline for compatibility for this one. 

## Can I see the mod lists?

> Ultra: (https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-ultra-profile)
> 
> High: (https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-high-profile)
> 
> Medium: (https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-medium-profile)
> 
> Low: (https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-low-profile)
> 
> Potato: (https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/wildlander-potato-profile)

## Can I see the differences to Ultimate Skyrim?

Yes - Click [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/151jvogISYYDSa-xUbPOmhQGVL4_gF457oLZX_VZy1fY/preview)

----------

# How do I update to the Current Version

To update a Modlist, simply run Wabbajack again and get the newest list file from the "Browse Modlists" section. Select the same Download and Install folders you chose previously, and select the "Overwrite" option on the bottom right. Backup any changes you have made to the modlist since your original install as these will be lost. If you want to keep any mods you've added to your personal install, rename those mods to start with `[NoDelete]` to force Wabbajack to skip those files. Note that support still won't be officially provided; use this feature at your own discretion. [here](https://www.wildlandermod.com/download)

Please Note: Some updates will require a brand new game and are not save compatible.

----------

# How do I Uninstall

We're sorry to see you leave!

Uninstalling Wildlander is a simple matter of deleting the installation folder.

Uninstalling the launcher requires you to use windows "Add / remove program" functionality.

----------

# Can I remove the downloads folder?

Yes - But if you want to install a update, or repair your install - you would need to redownload all 500+ Mods. 

You can however safely move your download folder to another harddrive.

----------


# Wabbajack Issues

## Wabbajack fails to download mods or hangs for a long time.

Sometimes Wabbajack gets stuck downloading.

1.  Close and restart Wabbajack - Start the Wildlander install process again, entering same criteria as originally. Wababjack will CRC check your existing files and should resume where it failed & complete the install without any further intervention.
2.  If you are experiencing issues with Wabbajack repeatedly failing to download one or more files (same files every time), try enabling the Network Workaround in Wabbajack settings.

3.  If that does not resolve the issue, try using a VPN service such as Cloudflare WARP or ProtonVPN. (Wildlander is not affiliated with and does not endorse any specific VPN service. We do not provide user support for VPN services. Use at your own discretion.)
    
4.  If above fails then manually download the file using the following procedure:-
    
    1.  Close Wabbajack
    2.  Go [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/mod-lists/blob/master/reports/wildlander/status.md) find the failing mod in the list. Click the link to manually download the file(s) and copy them into the downloads directory you specified when starting the Wabbajack install process
    3.  Restart Wabbajack - it will then proceed with the install

----------

## Getting a download failed on Elswaps Speed trees.

If you are unable to download MEGA files through Wabbajack you can [download](https://mega.nz/file/xUc0zRLY#NYwbmmHOZhpSF2hpV7hMRYejgZsL_MAIVv_DfjK9JRM) the file manually and save the Zip to the folder you entered as your "download location" from the wabbajack interface.

----------

## Getting a download failed on Original Skyrim files

If you get the following error - Make sure Steam is installed in English, validate your game files in Steam. Steam > Right Click > Properties > Local files tab
- Unable to download Skyrim_Default.ini 

Wildlander requires Aniversary edition, If you get any of the following - update your Skyrim.

# **Launcher Issues**

## What do the Dropdowns mean?

Quality Drop down

These are your standard Skyrim paramaters. The Graphics dropdown determines the quality of basic graphical elements, such as the draw distance of grass and shadows, the number of effects visible at once, and the quality of distant objects. These elements use a mix of CPU and GPU.

- Ultra  - Everything on, All the bells and whistles - For "beast" PC's
- High   - Reduced Draw distaces compared to Ultra, but still the full mod package.
- Medium - Reduced Draw distaces compared to High, but still the full mod package.
- Low    - No grass, no shadows, but still the full mod package.
- Potato - Stripped down lists for PC's which were build when oldrim was first released. 

Shaders Drop down

These control the level of ENB Shaders being applied. The Shaders dropdown determines the quality of post-processing effects, such as environment lighting, particle lighting, ambient occlusion, sun rays, and water effects. These elements are very heavy on the GPU.

- Ultra  - Default Zangdar's ENB Everything on, All the bells and whistles 
- Medium - Zangdar ENB Performance preset 
- Low    - Zangdar ENB Performance preset W/o Ambient Occlusion 
- No ENB - Run without shaders at all

----------

## Game doesn't boot when launching SKSE / Cannot Start SKSE_Loader Error

[![image of SKSE Error](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d1e2036affcaac1d9ca807db293176917ba048b5d0a53ad07c718ddef81618ad/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e646973636f72646170702e636f6d2f6174746163686d656e74732f3334383537393439353533373830333237342f3738343630333430313939353638313739342f436170747572652e504e47)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d1e2036affcaac1d9ca807db293176917ba048b5d0a53ad07c718ddef81618ad/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e646973636f72646170702e636f6d2f6174746163686d656e74732f3334383537393439353533373830333237342f3738343630333430313939353638313739342f436170747572652e504e47)

Ensure the following:

1.  Check that your Antivirus is not flagging SKSE or any Skyrim related files (best Solution is to add Antivirus exceptions to the Wildlander Directory and subdirectories.
    
2.  Make sure you content folder contains usvfs_proxy_x64.exe & usvfs_proxy_x86.exe. If these files are missing its likely your anti-virus has moved them to the virus vault.
    
3.  Restore missing files from Mod Organiser Zip file in your Wildlander\download directory if you cannot find them in the virus vault

----------

## Does this mod pack Support other languages?

No and if you try then SKSE crashes from Mod Organizer. You will need to install English Skyrim - Special Edition to play this modpack.

----------

## Does this pack support Ultrawide resolutions?
Unfortunatly, the Wildlander is not capable of supporting Fullscreen Ultrawide resolutions. The end result from our testing is as below.

* Camera issues - Too zoomed in during character creation, Fish-eye camera (E.g NPC's close to you are distorted/streched)
* UI Elements misaligned, being drawn partially off screen, some elements which should be centred far to the right or just plain missing completely
* Blank "pop-ups" E.g Informational messages during the new game process.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/145678355-6c1376e3-86de-4033-be4c-08e9b14779bd.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/146077138-966a88f8-3b23-43f0-8183-11931ffc97ef.png)


The launcher has therefore disabled any resolution known to cause the above issues, No support will be provided to allow Ultrawide resultions. Any attempts by yourself to do so will be considered a unsupported custom install - this will deny you access to support.


# **Customization Questions**

## Mod X has been updated, can I install that?

No, For stability reasons - only the versions installed by wabbajack are supported.

----------

## Can I remove/disable mod X?

Many mods have a Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) where they can be turned off. You cannot disable anything completly from Mod Organiser - this will deny you access to support.

----------

## Can I add additional mods?
Currently, we are not supporting any form of modification of Wildlander. 

Any modifications are done at your own risk and will deny you access to support.

# **Gameplay Questions**

## Can I see a list of Known issues?

Sure - Here's a [link](https://github.com/Wildlander-mod/Support/blob/master/Docs/KnownIssues.MD)

----------

## How can I see the keybindings?

The in-game hotkey F11 will bring up a Gampad/ keyboard layout of all keybindings. F11 again will hide it.

----------

## My keybindings don't work

Dylan is based in the US - so the keybindings were based on a standard QWERTY US keyboard.

For any other types of keyboards you will need to rebind the keys yourself from the mcm menus.

There is an appropriate guide [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Clm3z8O9R0TlVlHdoLYHQ6FeMQiB0MA6iUkazfaxFA/edit#gid=0)

----------

## Why can't I select the first crafting perk?

You need a book called The Craftsman's Manual in your inventory. It can be purchased from most blacksmiths. Most of the Requiem crafting perks require their own books, some of which can be bought while others must be found in the world.

----------

## Why can't I run or Why is my stamina going down for no reason?

Requiem applies a Stamina draining effect when you run, and when you wear armor without the first perk in the heavy/evasion armor tree. Running is the normal speed you move at if you aren't sprinting or specifically holding down the “walk” button. To combat this, make sure to buy food with a “Regenerate 1 stamina per second for X seconds” effect and keep that buff up at all times.

**NO YOU CANNOT DISABLE IT, PLEASE DON'T ASK!**

----------

## Why can't I get a blessing at a shrine?

Requiem's Gods are unforgiving of crime. Too much crime and they will no longer bless you or heal you!

----------

## Why am I not healing?

Requiem disables passive health regeneration, you will need to obtain a healing poltice or a potion to regenerate health.

----------

## Lights are flickering on and off

Most noticabled in Breezehome but can happen everywhere.

This is caused by Skyrim's engine limitation of 4 lightsources in a area. when you look in a area with more than 4 lightsurces they alternate/cycle and turn on and off.

----------

## Why does the NPC dialogue cut out when talking to Aela?

Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions Guild adds new conversation options to NPCs that aren't voiced. Other NPCs have the same behavior.

----------

## Why is everything so expensive in shops?

You're Naked - Put some clothes on ya filthy animal!

----------

## My character's animations are stuck.

This is a vanilla Skyrim bug, exacerbated by the scripted mods in Wildlander If jumping doesn't fix the animation, try the following console commands:

```
Pushactoraway 14 1
SetPlayerAIDriven 0

```
----
## Why can't I Fast Travel

Requiem disables Fast travel. There are multiple methods of moving around the map quickly without using this - There are boats near most large area of water, and Carriage drivers at the cities.

----------
## My game freezes during loading screens.

The game will pause if you are alt-tabbed out - including load screens. Make sure skyrim window has focus.

Can also be caused by :-
-   Your PC being below the minimum requirements to play the pack as shown on the install Readme. You can try running without a ENB from the launcher.
-   Wildlander folders(or subfolders) being read-only.
-   Wildlander being on a different drive to skyrim - Only resolution to this is to move Wildlander to same hard drive.
-   Wildlander being installed inside of program files - Move the Wildlander folder outside of program files.
-   Additional mods in skyrim\data folder from previous modding or workshop subscriptions are causing a conflict.
-   Conflict between AMD drivers and the ENB - only resolution to this is to either roll back until you find working AMD drivers or disable ENB graphics until a working driver is available.
-   A Corrupt Skyrim installation (to check, launch skyrim from steam and see if it crashes on loading screen)
-   Antivirus real-time scanning your Wildlander folders - add it to your exceptions.
-   You have lost permissions to write to "my documents\My Games\Skyrim" or Wildlander install folder
-   Onedrive and/or dropbox is Syncing your "my documents\My Games\Skyrim" or Wildlander install folder
-   Can be caused by a corrupt save, you can try using a previous save or start a new game.

----------

## How do I change the difficulty?

The in-game difficulty sliders do not work with Wildlander. Please use the Change Difficulty hotkey instead. 

----------

## I contracted Sanguinare Vampiris and now I can't sleep!

This is a 'Minor Arcana' change that prevents weak characters from acquiring Vampirism. You must survive for 3 days while Sanguinare Vampiris slowly drains health and negates natural healing, at which point you will become a Vampire.


----------

## Can I remove Quick restore from control?

Yes - The keybinding for this is in Iequip. Lizzy (being the sensible player that she is) switches it to 'C' and moves crouch using the Skyrim standard controls back to the default keybind.

----------

# **Questing Questions**

## How do I start the main quest?

Kill a dragon. 

----------

## Why can't I obtain the Dragonstone?

This quest is auto completed when you kill a dragon.

----------

## How do I Become Thane of Whiterun

There is a new way of becoming a Thane of Whiterun. Complete "The Blessings of Nature" quest (Danica by the Gildrergreen tree to start) and talk to Jarl Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired\the sappling blooms (note: this requires you to complete any other quest to simulate the passing of time). He'll thank you and allow you to do the standard thaneship quest (help the people of the hold).

Note: You can buy Breezehome before this at a much more expensive price, but unless you are thane you do not get the housecarl.

----------

## I can't start the Thieves Guild through Brynjolf.

**Thieves Guild Requirements** is included in the list, which requires a certain amount of pockets picked/items stolen.

----------

## How do I start the Dragonborn questline?

Dragonborn content is available after completing "A Blade in the Dark" during the Main Quest.


# **Crafting Questions**

## How do I craft Snowberry Extract?

At the forge. Requires Alchemy Lore Perk.

----------

## How do I craft Healing Poultice?

From the "Shift" craft menu.

Requires 5 "Medicinal Salve" and 1 "Bandage". Requires Alchemy Lore Perk or Craftmanship Perk. 

"Medicinal Salve" can be crafted from Blue Mountain Flower, or any ingredient with Restore Health. Requires Alchemy Lore Perk or Craftmanship Perk.

Bandage are the Linen Wrap item from Vanilla. They can be crafted from any cotton or linen cloth.
