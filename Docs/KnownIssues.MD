## Gameplay Issues
- The Drink/Refill hotkey (;) often unbinds itself. To fix this, go into the SunHelm MCM and rebind the key. (Press T to clear it, then ; to rebind it.)
- All forms of nighteye do not work. With ENB, no changes are made, without ENB whole screen goes blue.
- Quest I have "requiem for a better times" is stuck installing. this will not affect your gameplay - ignore it.
- Some crafting crecipes requiring bottled water dont work
- Using a controller on a lock is cauing the camera to fluff up
- Heartwood Mill Door Misplaced after entering
- Dodge perk is not working as intended when a controller is attached to the PC

- Faralda doesn't show up to allow you to join ( Workaround #1:  Stand on the bridge where Faralda is supposed to be, and type these two commands in the console: "prid  1C1A5" and "moveto player".  This will teleport her to you, and should initiate the acceptance test.  Workaround #2:  Type the following in the console to get past the acceptance test:  "setstage MG01 30".  You should only use that if you've met the minimum skill requirements for continuity reason)

- The stores contain static items which cant be stolen

### Heljarchen Farm
- was removed at last minute as we were unable to correct the bugs within.

### Properties Without Pestering
- Hjerim is not available for purchase after completing "blood on the ice" until you are Thane.
- You need to be carrying the full price of the house(before 'thane' deductions), even after completing the 'thane' quest (E.G if a hourse costs 35,000 before deductions, this is how much gold you need to be carrying, even though the house now only costs 20,000)

### Wearable lanterns
This mod is "touchy" in SE and breaks easily. 

1) You cannot turn on and off the light using the "L" hotkey

Workaround: use the MCM to change its slot to 46(cloak slot), equip the lantern, requip your cloak, then change the lanterns slot back to 56.

2) You spawn a carpet instead of a light.

Workaround:  Drop the lantern and console yourself a new one then Follow the procedure for issue 1.

If bathing in very cold water, it can kill you before the animation finishes. 

Work around: dont take a bath in cold water ;)
