## **Installing Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim with Seg's patch**

Even if you are familiar with[ Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545?tab=description), do check out the changes in[ Seg's Requiem patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=description) used here. Some of the tweaks are significant.

About the Ult Sky patch:

* _Forwarded all relevant scripts from "Book Covers Skyrim" book records. Retained book models and inventory art from "Book Covers Skyrim" mod._
* _Fixed a minor error in Stendarr's Fortify Block effect._
* _Arkay's Chalice of Life restoration effect now works as intended. Requiem's "No Natural Regen" permanent spell was blocking it._
* _Forwarded the appropriate quest activators that unlock the various daedric blessings._
* _Applied quest journal logs from "Even Better Quest Objectives" mod._
* _Resolved a script conflict with "House of Horrors Alternate Ending" mod._
* _Fixed a few invalid references in Seg's patch (it was made for an older version of Wintersun)._
* _Resolved a few magic effect conflicts related to blessings, and a couple of quest conflicts with "The Choice is Yours" mod._

To install:

1. Download and install[ Wintersun 3.1.5](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95545?tab=files) with MO2. Load the esp plugin anywhere between _Book Covers Skyrim.esp_ and _Requiem.esp._ On the screenshot below it is right before _Requiem.esp_. Mod position on the left side of MO does not matter (end of the mod list is fine).
2. Download and install[ Wintersun - Requiem patch (v1.4)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95859?tab=files) from Segolia94's patch collection. Load the esp between _Ultimate Skyrim.esp_ and _Requiem for the Indifferent.esp_.
3. Install [Wintersun 3.1.5 - Seg 1.4 - Ultsky 407](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hP53c8KQQz4plQGNl-qlLSpMnYFRVy0d/view?usp=sharing) On the left side of MO2 keep this patch **after** Wintersun mod and Seg's patch. On the right side of MO load the esp **after** Seg's patch and also **after** _Ultimate Skyrim - Book Covers Skyrim.esp_ **_._** You can place both patches there, as shown on the screenshot below.
4. Run the Reqtificator. Done.

_Note: If you are a Sanguine worshipper, and you are also using SNBCJ's "Requiem - Classic Food and Drink (R-CFD)" mod, make sure to load the Wintersun patches after the R-CFD patch, so that you'll get the correct effect from alcohol which boosts favor with Sanguine the more you drink._

*_Installing over an existing save:_

_Starting a new game is always the safest option when installing scripted mods. From my limited testing it seems to work fine when installed mid-game. Just make sure to let any active blessings expire before installing._
