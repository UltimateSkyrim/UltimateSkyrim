## Resistances list

List of basic resistances used in Skyrim.
|Type 	|	Cap|
|--|--|
|Damage (Armor Rating)| 	 	80%
|Poison| 	 	90%
|Fire  |	 	90%
|Frost |	 	90%
|Shock |	 	90%
|Magic |	 	90%

About AR (Armor Resistance) Values
  -  1 point reduces incoming physical damage by 0.1%. So 800 AR will reach the 80% cap when not considering Armor Penetration.
  -  1 point of Armor Penetration (AP) effectively reduces target AR by 1%. This means striking target with 500 AR with 10 AP makes the effective AR 450, making the target take 45% reduced damage not 50%.
  -  The AR cap applies after applying AP.

 
## Damage Types

Damage Types implemented by Requiem. Weapons are assigned one damage type, and Creatures are Sometimes given extra Damage Type Resistances that function as extra Armor Rating against each damage types.

|Type |	Default Source |
|--|--|
|Slashing |Sword, War Axe, Greatsword, Battleaxe
|Blunt 	|Mace, Warhammer
|Pierce |Dagger
|Ranged |Bow, Crossbow



## Domesticated animals

Domesticated animals are usually found in camps, villages, cities or occasionally wandering about alone. If these animals are harmed or stolen (in the case of horses), the Dragonborn will earn a bounty in that hold or city.

###Wolves

These guys are fast, but any ranged attack can kill them before they get you. Just before they leap, dodge to the side. Its tricky at first but with practice you can do it almost everytime. If not you can try to bash them mid air.

###Chaurus

Chaurus are worm-like insectoid creatures that typically live underground in caves and even in Dwemer ruins. They are deadly creatures, possessing the ability to spit out poisonous venom from their mouths, but they also use bite attacks during combat. Chaurus are almost always seen with Falmer in the underground cave networks and Dwemer ruins of Skyrim. The Chaurus appear to be used by the Falmer as pets and as fighters in combat, as well as torturers of people when their Falmer masters attack and capture bandits, traveling caravans and other people.
