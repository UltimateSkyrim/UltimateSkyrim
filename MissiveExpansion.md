* Newspaper delivery a la black horse courier (there's a black horse courier mod out there too)
* Necromancy spell scroll smuggling (pick up X spells or tomes from a dead drop, get them to Y NPC in a city on the other side of skyrim)
* A missive placed on a town which has a khajiit camp where you go beat up the khajiits to force them to move on
* Missives in Windhelm to go brawl/attack random dark elves or argonians that belong to Windhelm

* Supply the quartermasters (food, raw materiels ect)
* Locate a enemy camp and retrieve intel
* Kill a "spy" npc at a enemy camp
* deliver a letter to home.

# From discussions with Dylan
  
* Buy a House Missive - this would be a One-off type missive. Once complete, it wont reappear.
* Gossip notes.
* Ability to have a missive quest which adds items to the gameworld in specific places - but dont trigger a quest.
