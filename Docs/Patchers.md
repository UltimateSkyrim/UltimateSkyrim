# Extra Patchers

## FNIS (Fore’s New Idles for Skyrim) 

FNIS (Fore’s New Idles for Skyrim) is a utility that allows mods to use new animations. It’s already installed on your machine, but if you need to rerun it.

Open the folder where you installed Ultimate Skyrim and run ModOrganizer.exe. 

Click [here](https://youtu.be/thfOQIdW0Cg?t=78) for a video tutorial on installing FNIS that was created for older versions of Ultimate Skyrim.
The information is still correct, though your Mod Organizer folder will be wherever you installed Ultimate Skyrim.
Close the video once FNIS installation is complete. Do not continue past FNIS installation.


## AUTOMATIC VARIANTS 

Automatic Variants is an optional mod that creates visual variety for certain animals, monsters, etc. 

Open the folder where you installed Ultimate Skyrim and run ModOrganizer.exe.

Click [here](https://youtu.be/thfOQIdW0Cg?t=814) for a video tutorial on installing Automatic Variants that was created for older versions of Ultimate Skyrim.
Like with FNIS, the information is still mostly correct, though your Mod Organizer folder will be wherever you installed Ultimate Skyrim, and your Automatic Variants folder will be named “AV”.
Close the video once Automatic Variants installation is complete. Do not continue past Automatic Variants installation.

With Automatic Variants, animal & creature appearances will differ realistically.


## DYNDOLOD 

DynDOLOD is an optional mod that greatly improves the appearance of distant terrain. It can affect your framerate, but the impact isn’t too bad & I think the visual difference is well worth it.

Click [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59721?tab=files) to to download DynDOLOD. (You want the “Manual Download”, as shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/ONuUpNK.jpg) You will also want to download the Dyndalod Resources for the same version as DynDOLOD itself if you are running 4.0.7.

Copy the downloaded files to a location of your choosing - preferably the same drive as your Skyrim install.

Open the folder where you installed Ultimate Skyrim and run ModOrganizer.exe. 

Install the Resources and enable like you would a new mod. the Fomod Settings are as follows:-

[Click the “Modify Executables” button](https://i.imgur.com/urDHApv.jpg), enter “DynDOLOD” as the Title, and then click the ellipses next to the “Binary” field.

Navigate to where you placed the DynDOLOD files, select DynDOLOD.exe,  and then click “Apply” to finalize the executable.
Your button may show “Add” or "Modify” or "Apply" - Any are fine. 

Click [here for a video tutorial on running DynDOLOD](https://youtu.be/thfOQIdW0Cg?t=1130) that was created for older versions of Ultimate Skyrim.
The information is still generally correct and any slight differences are not a problem, except that you should not disable DynDOLOD.esp as the video instructs, Instead you should ##DISABLE## the entire mod on the left side. 
Close the video once DynDOLOD installation is complete. Do not continue past DynDOLOD installation.

Once complete, copy your Dyndolod output folder to your content\mods\ folder, re-open mod organiser and activate the "dyndolod_output" mod. Place the Dyndolod.esp just above requiem of the indifferent on the right side of the load order. Do not disable the Dyndolod resources mod.
