## Modding Basics
Installing Mods not covered by guides.

- Download it to your Wildlander download folder (this will be the directory you entered on the wabbajack installer when you first installed the list)
open < Wildlander install directory >\Game-files\mod organiser.exe. Once open - top left dropdown - select the profile you plan on playing.
- select download tab on right side
- find the mod in the list and right click > install (you may need to click the refresh button to make it appear)
- choose your settings (if it has installation options) then once its finished installing turn it on, on the left side of the mod organizer (should be at bottom of the list).
- **Important** if patching from "Requiem patch central" Untick any ticked patches for mods in the base wildlander install, and only tick ones for mods you are adding yourself.
- If you mod doesn’t have any ESP/ESM's then that’s it - otherwise continue!

Sort your (right side) Plugins load order manually (LOOT IS THE DEVIL - ERASE its Existence from your memory).

If there isn't a specific guide, then as a general rule of thumb

- Anything that adds spells, weapons, followers or other types of NPCs should go ABOVE Requiem.esp (right pane of MO2)
- Patches always have to be below the mod they are patching, thus the requiem patches will be below Requiem.esp by the other requiem patches while your mod will be above Requiem.esp.
- Any mods which don't Add new NPCS, followers, Spells and weapons, should be installed below the wildlander Full mod(E.g. Autosave manager, bathtubs Basins and beyond, tentpalooza)
- Run the reqtificator whenever you change the load order.

Close mod organizer - and use the launcher to start the game.

## Known Mod Issues/Incompatibilities

The following Types of mods are NOT Compatible. (cause game breaking bugs)
> * Any Alternate start mod. (Skyrim reloaded reborn is included in the list, which acts as a alternate start mod. It cannot be removed and replaced with something else)
> * Any Mod which affects the perk trees E.g. Ordinator 
> * Truly Absorb Dragon Souls, DSAMG - Dragon Soul Absorb More Glorious and Dragon Remains (prevents the main quest from firing upon killing a dragon)
> * Cold & Wet SE - causes Various CTD
> * Populated Cities Towns Village SE - Can cause the game to bug out into an endless loading scene when entering cities. COC'ing into one of the cities shops and leaving into the city from there circumvents and fixes it for some time
> * New Races (unless requiem patch available) Requiem won’t start and will return you to the main menu.
> * Skyrim Together (Just doesnt work)  

The following Mods are extremely script heavy, Will possibly break your game.
> *  Open Cities (also requires a tonne of manual patching)
> *  Sexlab Separate Orgasms (known to cause fps degradation/script bloat)

The following types of mods have Issues 
> *  New creatures/enemies/NPC's/followers   (unless requiem patch available) - Note: for enemies - they are generally added as unleveled, and in requiem this means they are always level 1. for NPC's and Followers - they will be missing the requiem perks and may also be unleveled (ergo level 1)
> *  Dead NPC Body Cleaner Remover (caused Immortal Vampires when you attempt to burn them, also causes civil war patrols to scream like banshee's)  
> *  New Quest area mods   (unless requiem patch available) - Note: This is because new area's generally add new creatures/enemies/NPC's and followers
> *  3Tweaks ( It also changes so much stuff, that it won't be compatible with anything without 3tweaks dedicated patch - which just doesn't exist for the bulk of the mods in the list - Including Wildlander.esp itself).
