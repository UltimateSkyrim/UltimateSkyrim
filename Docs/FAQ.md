## Does this mod pack support SSE?

Currently, Ultimate Skyrim is only for Skyrim Classic Edition w/ All DLC’s, otherwise known as Skyrim Legendary Edition. A port to SSE is in the works, but still a ways off. You can follow progress by catching the weekly streams - currently on mondays at 8pm GMT (announced on reddit, and in discord annoucement channel)

You can buy Legendary Edition from one of these places:

[https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-legendary-edition](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-legendary-edition)

[https://uk.gamesplanet.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-legendary-edition-steam-key--1057-5](https://uk.gamesplanet.com/game/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-legendary-edition-steam-key--1057-5)

# **Wabbajack Issues**
## Wabbajack Fails to install with GameFileSourceDownloader Error
If you have Wabbajack Fail with the following messages
![Image of GameFileSourceDownloader error](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348579495537803274/759424545957871616/unknown.png)

There are three Known causes
1) You have Skyrim installed in program files

	Solution: Close and Run Wabbajack installer as a administrator.
	
2) You have previously "cleaned" your DLC.

	Solution: Have steam verify the game files. 
	
3) You have moved your Skyrim Install from where you originally installed it.

	Solution: Move it back, and use steam to move it to the new location.

After doing the solution 2 or 3, you will need to restart wabbajack.

---
## Wabbajack Fails to download mods or hangs for a long time.
Sometimes wabbajack gets stuck downloading.

1) Close and restart wabbajack - it will normally resume where it failed & complete the install without any further intervention.

2) If above fails then (with the exception to ultsky 4.0.7 Dyndalod.rar - this one must be downloaded via wabbajack) manually download the file using the following procedure:-

	1) Close wabbajack
	2) Go [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/modlists/gallery) Find Ultimate skyrim in the list - then select Archive search in bottom right hand corner
	3) Use the search bar in top right to find the mod(s) which fail to download automatically
	4) Use the "link" icon next to the download to manually download the file(s) and copy into the downloads directory you specified when starting the wabbajack install process
	5) Restart wabbajack - it will then proceed with the install

3) If Dyndalod is the one Stuck, please try a free VPN such as nordvpn or proton and restart wabbajack. If this fails to work, please visit official discord and ask for assistence in the ultsky-support channel

# **Install Questions**

## How do i setup a steam library outside of program files

The wabbajack team has a handy utility to help you do that [here](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide)

## I’m missing master for HighResTexturePack01-03 or My game CTD after Skyrim Logo

If you are experiencing a missing master for HighResTexturePack01-03 the simplest fix is to download and enable the High Res DLC from https://store.steampowered.com/app/202485/Skyrim_High_Resolution_Texture_Pack_Free_DLC/

Alternatively, you can re-run the reqtificator to generate a new Requiem For The Indiferent.esp (RFTI) without the High Res DLC as a master. This will be fixed in the next release.

If you have issues viewing the DL, try this work around https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimateskyrim/comments/galfjk/high_res_texture_pack_info/

## Game doesn't boot when launching SKSE / Cannot Start SKSE_Loader Error
![image of SKSE Error](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348579495537803274/784603401995681794/Capture.PNG)

Ensure the following:

1. Check that your Antivirus is not flagging SKSE or any Skyrim related files (best Solution is to add Antivirus exceptions to  the Ultimate Skyrim & skyrim folders

2. Make sure you content folder contains usvfs_proxy_x64.exe & usvfs_proxy_x86.exe If these files are missing its likely your anti-virus has moved them to the virus vault.

3. Restore Missing files from Mod Organiser Zip file in your Ultimate Skyrim\download directory if cannot find in virus vault
---
## Game Hard CTD on Splashscreen
note: You may get a error messages about missing d3dx9_43.dll.

1) Download DirectX End-User Runtimes from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) Note: This will give you a zip file disguised as a EXE - not the actual installer itself

2) Unpack the downloaded file into a directory (E.g C:\directX\)

3) Open the directory and run Setup.exe. Follow onscreen instructions.

4) (optional but recommended) Reboot your PC.

---

## Skyrim has failed to allocate memory! or Possibly running out of memory

If your game CTDs with an error from Crash Fixes saying "Skyrim has failed to allocate memory! Possibly running out of memory...", or it crashes during/after the character creation screen, the most likely cause is a bad ENB installation.

Open  “enblocal.ini” in your Skyrfilm folder and then configure it according to this [guide](https://imgur.com/yfBDnJI).

---

# **Customization Questions**
## Can someone help with my load order?

The Ultimate Skyrim Support Team cannot assist with this issue as there are too many variables. 

Do not use L.O.O.T or rearrange Ultimate Skyrim’s default mods unless a guide from one of us specifically tells you to!

---

## Mod X has been updated, can I install that?

No, For stability reasons - only the versions listed on the Ultimate Skyrim Manual Install webpage ([https://www.ultimateskyrim.com/manual-install](https://www.ultimateskyrim.com/manual-install)) are supported.

---

## Can I remove/disable mod X?

Many mods have a Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) where they can be turned off. Also, some mods are considered optional, so they can be disabled or uninstalled in Mod Organizer. If you remove an optional mod that has an esp plugin, you will need to run the Reqtificator and possibly Automatic Variants patcher. 

---

## Can I Add Additional mods?

The answer to this is "sometimes". 

The following Types of mods are NOT Compatible
* Any Alternate start mod.
* Any Mod which affects the perk trees (E.g Ordinator)
* Truly Absorb Dragon Souls (prevents the main quest from firing upon killing a dragon)

As a General rule - Anything without a ESP such as body replacers (E.g CBBE. UNP. S.o.S) and clutter textures can be added with no problems and no need to run the requiem patcher(Reqtificator).

Follower and Quest mods will generally need Requiem patching so their NPC's stand a chance against you and your followers and followers stand a chance against NPCs. New ingredients can break Requiem's alchemy balance, new food will likely need iNeed patching, some equipment might require Frostfall patching, and so forth. 

Please visit the Ultimate Skyrim Discord #ultsky-customsation channel - for install guides and advice for other type of mods.

---

## Does This mod pack Support other languages?

No and if you try then SKSE crashes from Mod Organizer. You will need to install English Skyrim to play this modpack.

---

## Can I backup and restore Ultimate Skyrim

Yes, please follow this guide https://github.com/phinocio/UltimateSkyrim/blob/master/Docs/Backup.md


---
## I want to setup rodericktech guide for fancy graphics - where are the patcher instructions.

Reqtificator is located [here](https://github.com/phinocio/UltimateSkyrim/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#how-do-i-install-the-reqtificator)

Other Patchers(AV, Dyndolod ect) are located [here](https://github.com/phinocio/UltimateSkyrim/blob/master/Docs/Patchers.md)

---

# **Reqtificator Questions**
## How do i Install the Reqtificator?
Firstly make sure you have Java installed in Program Files. the version in Program Files(x86) does not work. If you don't have it - you can download it [here](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

after checking that -

1) Simply visit this [page](https://requiem.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RS/pages/691470460/Installing+Requiem+with+Mod+Organizer+2), and begin with Step 4. (Steps 1, 2, and 3 have already been done for you.)

2) When the patcher asks if you are running a new game, select “Yes, this is a new game.”

3) When the patcher notifies you about having over 100 plugins, select “Ignore from now on”.

4) You can leave everything default for Step 7.

---

## There was no consistency file found

![Image of consistency error](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348579495537803274/732081869386022942/unknown.png)

Select “Yes, this is a new game.”

---

## Automatically allocating memory failed

![Image of memory error](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565772668318646272/740336349202087958/unknown.png)

Your binary path for java is wrong. The Reqtificator error message tells you that you're using 32-bit java instead of 64. Check your paths in _Step 5_[ https://requiem.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RS/pages/691470460/Installing+Requiem+with+Mod+Organizer+2+version+3.2.0+and+older](https://requiem.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RS/pages/691470460/Installing+Requiem+with+Mod+Organizer+2+version+3.2.0+and+older)

---

## It says I am using more than 100 plugins

![Image of more than 100 plugins error](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/348579495537803274/731601149848977518/unknown.png)

Select ignore from now on

---

## The Reqtificator won't start. When I press "Run", MO2 locks up, then unlocks and nothing happens; or MO2 returns a "Directory name is invalid" error.

In most cases this is due to a typo in the folder path for the Requiem Skyproc patcher. The path should be: **\<path to your Skyrim installation>\Data\SkyProc Patchers\Requiem**. Many users omit the 's' at the end of "SkyProc Patchers" when creating the folder. Also confirm that the "Start in" path in your MO2 Reqtificator configuration matches the path.

---

# **MCM Questions**

## What does the MCM guide mean about template saves?

There is unfortunately no way to Copy MCM settings over to a new character for every mod. 

The closest thing is creating a "template save" by configuring the bulk of the MCM's. then loading this template save everytime you want to create a new character. You will then only need to do the "post-Start" MCM setups (approx the last 2 pages)

A template save will be the save game you make _before_ clicking on _Begin My Adventure_ in the Ultimate Skyrim MCM menu, you will want to do this so next time you start a new character you won’t have to re-configure everything before the Ultimate Skyrim MCM!

Disclaimer

*Certain elements of a game are *baked* into Skyrim the *exact moment* Start New Game is selected. These types of elements are; Locations of certain items*

---
## iNeeds MCM page is blank

This happens when you start MCM config before the mod has finished initialising. 

Solution 1) Reboot the MCM's - Open console and use command 
	_setstage ski_configmanagerinstance 1_ Then wait for the MCM's to finish loading in top left hand corner.
	
Solution 2) Create a brand new game, wait for MCM's to finish initialising(top left) and try again.

# **Gameplay Questions**

---

## My Compass has disappeared!

This is intentional. Immersive HUD hides this functionality by default. To make the compass _temporarily_ visible again press the delete key.

-   To make it permanently visible, change the MCM setting in Immersive HUD > Compass Activation > Key Press Toggles. Be sure to change the hotkey away from DEL.


---


## Why can't I select the first crafting perk?

You need a book called The Craftsman’s Manual in your inventory. It can be purchased from most blacksmiths. Most of the Requiem crafting perks require their own books, some of which can be bought while others must be found in the world.

---

## Why is my stamina going down for no reason?

Requiem applies a stamina draining effect when you run, and when you wear armor without the first perk in the heavy/evasion armor tree. Running is the normal speed you move at if you aren’t sprinting or specifically holding down the “walk” button. To combat this, make sure to buy food with a “Regenerate 1 stamina per second for X seconds” effect and keep that buff up at all times.

---

## Error: Incompatible menu file(Map.swf) when opening the map.

You missed an MCM setting in SkyUI! Open SkyUI MCM Menu > Advanced > uncheck SWF Version Checking

---

## My vision is all Blurry/Messed up!

 1) This can happen if you eat too many alchemy ingredients too quickly. Find and eat a Nirnroot to remove the effect.
 2) Check you active effects, you might have picked up a disease and require a potion of cleansing.

---

## The screen randomly went dark shortly after I entered &lt;insert name here &gt;.

This is caused by Darker Dungeons. If you would like to disable this option, open up Darker Dungeons MCM > General Configuration > _untick_ Do Fadeout On Dungeon Entry.

---

## I tried to learn a spell from a Tome - the book disappeared but I still don't know it

You missed loading SV Mods Preset during your Post-Start MCM Setup. To fix navigate to SV’s MCM menu > Save/Load Preset > FISS > Click ‘Load Preset’.

---

## Why does the NPC dialogue cut out when talking to Aela?

Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions Guild adds new conversation options to NPCs that aren’t voiced. Other NPCs have the same behavior.

---

## My game has no grass or has very little grass

Ensure the following are set in Content\Profiles\<Profile you play>\:

1. Make sure that skyrim.ini has the settings `bAllowCreateGrass`, `bAllowLoadGrass`, and `bDrawShaderGrass` set to 1

2. Decrease the `iMinGrassSize=` setting, this will increase grass density(default Skyrim has a setting of 20, 60 is the recommended if you are using a plugin like Verdant)

3. Change `iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure=` Default is 5 and max is 15. (note: the misspelling of texture is a mistake on Bethesda's and should be replicated)

---

## Why is everything so expensive in shops?

You’re Naked - Put some clothes on ya filthy animal!

---

## I am getting a lot of stutter / CTD?

Make sure that you haven't included a comma in the memory field in ENBlocal.ini

Try turning off vsync & g-sync for Skyrim(TESV.exe) in the Graphics Card Settings.

Close down any background programs which maybe injecting into direct X (graphics card software such as geforce experience and MSI afterburn are two culprits)

Check your background processes. Skyrim is highly reliant on CPU - Core 0, so if your CPU is busy with other tasks it might be causing the stutters

Run Bmxfreestyle’s Stability Guide and follow the recommended tweaks (pinned in #ultsky-support).

---

## When I equip my Lantern/Backpack I get a pouch/book holder appearing in my inventory

This is a bug - cause unknown. Although there is no permanent fix, you can _possibly_ solve it by either dropping and buying a new item OR by dropping your item and consoling one in.

---

## When I equip my Belt items it doesn’t ask me which slot I want to put it in

Drop the item, and pick it back up then it will ask you where you would like to place it.

---

## When I drop items on the ground, they sometimes vanish

1. This seems to happen occasionally when dropping items in 1st person view. Try switching to 3rd person before dropping them.

2. if the items are related to one of the following mods; Campfire, Wearable Lanterns, or Bandoliers - Bags and Pouches, this is likely due to a corrupted ID(BAD EDITOR ID when you do player.showinventory)

---

## My Lantern/Tent is asking me where I’d like it equipped

This is due to a bad ID, breaking down your lantern and recrafting it in the crafting ledger usually fixes your lantern, if you have the craftsman perk it's advisable to make your own, if you don't just purchase a new tent from any vendor.

---

## How do I re-enable menus pausing?

SkyrimSouls.ini controls which functions pause the game. You can edit the INI file from Mod Organiser. Right click the `Ultimate Skyrim 4.0.6 hf2` or  `Ultimate Skyrim 4.0.7 ore files` mod in the left pane -> Information -> ini files tab.

---

## My character's animations are stuck.
This is a vanilla Skyrim bug, exacerbated by the scripted mods in Ultimate Skyrim. If jumping doesn’t fix the animation, try the following console commands:

	Pushactoraway 14 1
	SetPlayerAIDriven 0

---

## I keep hearing strange noises around me or objects floating around

This is usually a symptom of a known physics engine limitation, causing game instability at framerates higher than 60 FPS.  The easiest workaround is to limit the framerate to 60 FPS, either in the ENB configuration (Shift+Enter opens it in-game), or in the GPU software.

---

## If you have Clouds on your Paper world map

This is a Known issue - Please visit the Official discord #ultsky-FAQ channel for the list of known issues and correction instructions
	
---
## My Character Spawned Underwater

If you load into the game (or start a new character) and your character is underwater while outside, usually near either Whiterun or Markarth's bridges. The Fix is to Enter a nearby building then exit again to force skyrim to re-load the cell.


----
## Why Can't I Fast Travel

Requiem disables Fast travel. There are multiple methods of moving around the map quickly without using this - There are boats near most large area of water, and Carriage drivers at the cities.

----
## My game freezes during loading screens.

The game may appear frozen, but it's usually still loading in the background. This is caused by OneTweak's Windowless Bordered mode. 

* Please make sure that Windows Task manager is not running.
* Disable Save on wait and Save on travel and switch to using manual saves.

----
## How do I change the difficulty?

The in-game difficulty sliders do not work with Requiem. Use the Damage Dealt/Taken values in the Requiem MCM instead. The recommended setting for both sliders is 100%. Requiem increases the difficulty of the game significantly, so if you're having a hard time doing anything, take a look at the [Beginner Guide for New Requiem Players](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/1w5cej/surviving_the_first_few_hours_in_requiem_or/).

----
## I contracted Sanguinare Vampiris and now I can't sleep!

This is a Minor Arcana change that prevents weak characters from acquiring Vampirism. You must survive for 3 days while Sanguinare Vampiris slowly drains health and negates natural healing, at which point you will become a Vampire.

----
# **4.0.6 Issues**


## I have this really weird red/green/brown/black graphical issue on the bottom half of my screen

4.0.6 Issue

![Image of memory error](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/348579495537803274/594565620096434192/unknown.png)

You probably messed up installing the custom INI files. Make sure you are installing Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini in the `\Ultimate Skyrim 4.0.x\profiles\Ultimate Skyrim 4.0.x (Full)` folder!

---

## My rain splashes are purple/pink!
