## Chaurus 

Chaurus are worm-like insectoid creatures that typically live underground in caves and even in Dwemer ruins. They are deadly creatures, possessing the ability to spit out poisonous venom from their mouths, but they also use bite attacks during combat. Chaurus are almost always seen with Falmer in the underground cave networks and Dwemer ruins of Skyrim. The Chaurus appear to be used by the Falmer as pets and as fighters in combat, as well as torturers of people when their Falmer masters attack and capture bandits, traveling caravans and other people.

## Falmer
Falmer, once known as Snow Elves, were thought to have been hunted to extinction by the Nords. 
They now live deep underground and have devolved into disfigured, violent remnants of their former selves, and their senses have adapted to a life in the dark. 
Their primitive weapons and armor are made from Chaurus chitin, and they often live near Chaurus, apparently keeping some of them as livestock.

## Wisps

Wisps are glowing, spherical creatures flying around that will attack the Dragonborn. They are usually near their mother, the Wispmother, who is a female, glowing humanoid being that is difficult to defeat. Shades are creatures different from the creature type shades, as they are ghostly apparitions conjured by a Wispmother.
