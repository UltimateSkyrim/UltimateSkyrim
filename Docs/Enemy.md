## Resistances List

List of basic resistances used in Skyrim.
|Type 	|	Cap|
|--|--|
|Damage (Armor Rating)| 	 	80%
|Poison| 	 	90%
|Fire  |	 	90%
|Frost |	 	90%
|Shock |	 	90%
|Magic |	 	90%

About AR (Armor Resistance) Values
  -  1 point reduces incoming physical damage by 0.1%. So 800 AR will reach the 80% cap when not considering Armor Penetration.
  -  1 point of Armor Penetration (AP) effectively reduces target AR by 1%. This means striking target with 500 AR with 10 AP makes the effective AR 450, making the target take 45% reduced damage not 50%.
  -  The AR cap applies after applying AP.

 
## Damage Types

Damage Types implemented by Requiem. Weapons are assigned one damage type, and Creatures are Sometimes given extra Damage Type Resistances that function as extra Armor Rating against each damage types.

|Type |	Default Source |

|Blunt 	|Mace, Warhammer
|Pierce |Dagger
|Ranged |Bow, Crossbow
