* A missive placed on a town which has a khajiit camp where you go beat up the khajiits to force them to move on
* Missives in Windhelm to go brawl/attack random dark elves or argonians that belong to Windhelm
* Missive to collect a item from a dead budy in the hall of the dead "one of my operatives was killed in action. His body has been taken to the hall of the dead - but if i know him right - he swallowed the item i asked him to retrive. Go and get it"

## Civil war camp missives
  
* Supply the quartermasters (food, raw materiels ect)
* Locate a enemy camp and retrieve intel
* Kill a "spy" npc at a enemy camp

## Good guy missives
  
* Temper a weapon/armor for a NPC. (collect it - temper it and return it)

# From discussions with Dylan
  
* Buy a House Missive - this would be a One-off type missive. Once complete, it wont reappear.
* Gossip notes.
* Ability to have a missive quest which adds items to the gameworld in specific places - but dont trigger a quest.
